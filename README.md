The class word guessing game Hangman

Hangman is a simple word guessing game that allows a player the chance to guess letters of
a hidden word (or the word itself).  This game gives a player 6 chances to guess the word
before being 'hung'.  This game of Hangman contains a list of 500+ words that can be used
or words entered during game time (note, if the word file cannot be found, words must be

and are limited to 20 characters.
The game includes several setable options including defining your own list of words,
selecting game sounds, to use sound or not and to display some of the prompts or not.
